Capability-based authorization.

Views ask for a named *capability* (e.g. "manage_fees"), never for specific
role names. The single source of truth for "which roles have which capability"
is the CAPABILITIES map below — change a role's access in one place and every
endpoint that guards on that capability follows automatically.

Usage in a view module:

    from ..permissions import require_capability, user_can

    @require_capability('download_backups')
    def api_download_backup(request):
        ...

    # or, when GET and POST need different capabilities in one view:
    if request.method == 'POST' and not user_can(request.user, 'manage_salaries'):
        return capability_denied()
